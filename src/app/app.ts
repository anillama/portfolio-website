    aboutMe: `Senior Software Engineer with strong experience in Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and microservices. I specialize in designing and developing scalable, secure backend systems, with a focus on clean architecture and performance.
    
    My work includes building RESTful APIs for seamless service communication, integrating Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming, and optimizing PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and query performance. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver reliable, production-ready solutions that support business goals.
    
    I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from California State University, East Bay, and bring a solid full-stack background across Java, Angular, Kafka, and microservices-based systems. Outside of work, I enjoy staying current with new technologies, refining system design skills, traveling, and spending quality time with family.`
